The General crawl settings
==========================

Describes the settings related to crawling.

How to set up
-------------

In Administrator account click crawl General menu after login.

You can specify the path to a generated index and replication
capabilities to enable.

Scheduled full crawl frequency
------------------------------

You can set the interval at which the crawl for a Web site or file
system. By default, the following.

::

    0 0 0 * * ?

Figures are from left, seconds, minutes, during the day, month,
represents a day of the week. Description format is similar to the Unix
cron settings. This example, and am 0 時 0 分 to crawling daily.

Following are examples of how to write.

| 0 0 12 \* \*?           | Each day starts at 12 pm                                                         |

Also check if the seconds can be set to run at intervals 60 seconds by
default. If you set seconds exactly and you should customize
webapps/fess/WEB-INF/classes/chronosCustomize.dicon taskScanIntervalTime
value, if enough do I see in one-hour increments.

Mobile translation
------------------

If these PC website search results on mobile devices may not display
correctly. And select the mobile conversion, such as if the PC site for
mobile terminals, and to show that you can. You can if you choose Google
Google Wireless Transcoder allows to display content on mobile phones.
For example, if site for PC and mobile devices browsing the results in
the search for mobile terminals search results will link in the search
result link passes the Google Wireless Transcoder. You can use smooth
mobile transformation in mobile search.

Replication features
--------------------

To enable replication features that can apply already copied the Solr
index generated. For example, you can use them if you want to search
only in the search servers crawled and indexed on a different server,
placed in front.

Index commit, optimize
----------------------

After the data is registered for Solr. Index to commit or to optimize
the registered data becomes available. If optimize is issued the Solr
index optimization, if you have chosen, you choose to commit the commit
is issued.

Server switchovers
------------------

|Fess| can combine multiple Solr server as a group, the group can manage
multiple. Solr server group for updates and search for different groups
to use. For example, if you had two groups using the Group 2 for update,
search for use of Group 1. After the crawl has been completed if
switching server updates for Group 1, switches to group 2 for the
search. It is only valid if you have registered multiple Solr server
group.

Committed to the document number of each
----------------------------------------

To raise the performance of the index in |Fess| while crawling and sends
for Solr document in 20 units. For each value specified here because
without committing to continue adding documents documents added in the
Solr on performance, Solr issued document commits. By default, after you
add documents 1000 is committed.

Number of concurrent crawls settings
------------------------------------

|Fess| document crawling is done on Web crawling, and file system CROLL.
You can crawl to a set number of values in each crawl specified here
only to run simultaneously multiple. For example, crawl setting number
of concurrent as 3 Web crawling set 1-set 10 if the crawling runs until
the set 3 3 set 1-. Complete crawl of any of them, and will start the
crawl settings 4. Similarly, setting 10 to complete one each in we will
start one.

But you can specify the number of threads in the crawl settings
simultaneously run crawl setting number is not indicates the number of
threads to start. For example, if 3 in the number of concurrent crawls
settings, number of threads for each crawl settings and 5 3 x 5 = 15
thread count up and crawling.

Expiration date of the index
----------------------------

You can automatically delete data after the data has been indexed. If
you select the 5, with the expiration of index register at least 5 days
before and had no update is removed. If you omit data content has been
removed, can be used.

Snapshot path
-------------

Copy index information from the index directory as the snapshot path, if
replication is enabled, will be applied.
